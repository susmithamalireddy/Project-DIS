            <p>What most people think of as “America’s Everglades” is limited to Everglades National Park, 1.5 million acres of subtropical wilderness in South Florida. But the River of Grass is close to 3 million acres, double the size of the park, and it encompasses the park, three water conservation areas and Big Cypress National Preserve. The greater Everglades ecosystem is even larger and originally encompassed 6 million acres extending all the way from the Kissimmee River basin near Orlando, south to Florida Bay and the Florida Keys.The original “River of Grass” was almost twice its current size before we “drained the swamp” for agriculture and development in one of mankind’s biggest reclamation efforts.</p>
